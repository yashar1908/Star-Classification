Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset?datasetId=391127&sortBy=voteCount

Dataset Info:
This is a dataset consisting of several features of stars.

Some of them are:

Absolute Temperature (in K)
Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
Relative Radius (R/Ro)
Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)
Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)**
Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)
Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)

Purpose:
The purpose of making the dataset is to prove that the stars follows a certain graph in the celestial Space ,
specifically called Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram or simply HR-Diagram
so that we can classify stars by plotting its features based on that graph.

Implemented K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest Classifier on the given dataset to classify the stars according to their types.
